## Autonomous Mobile Robots

These readings intended to serve as a brief introduction to the field of autonomous mobile robots in general and small-scale multi-robot systems in particular. The readings should be very helpful to refer to as you go through your design process. 

**Reading Material:**
- [Intro. to Autonomous Mobile Robots](assets/Pages_IntroAutRobots.pdf) ~5 pages, mostly pictures
- [A Survey of Autonomous Mobile Robot Testbeds](assets/Testbeds_survey.pdf) ~10 pages, context for our swarm
- [The HeRo 2.0 Low Cost Robot for Swarm Reserach](assets/hero2.pdf) ~20 pages, very relevant to design process
