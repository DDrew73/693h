## Fusion - MCAD

Autodesk Fusion is a 3D CAD (computer aided design) software tool designed for all kinds of engineering applications. Direct competitors to Fusion in the MCAD (mechanical computer aided design) / 3D modeling space include SolidWorks and Onshape. **We are going to use Fusion in this class** for two main reasons: 1) it has strong cloud-based project/team design management tools; and 2) it has the most advanced paired ECAD/MCAD capabilities. In a later task we will dive into ECAD (aka PCB design), here we will focus on getting you up and running with Fusion, including some basic tutorials to get you familiar with the software.  

- Register for an [Autodesk Edu student account](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview#FSN) and download Fusion
- Work through these tutorials: 
    - [Day 1 of a Learn Fusion in 30 Days series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr&index=5)
    - [Day 5 of a Learn Fusion in 30 Days series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN44hW9zX1I&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr&index=8)
    - [Day 19 of a Learn Fusion in 30 Days series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJULiA1aTtM&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr&index=23) - I think parameters are a hugely underutilized tool, especially by novice modelers. Learn how to use them from the get-go and you will be better off!
    - [Day 13 of a Learn Fusion in 30 Days series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj3_doWX2Kg&list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-C4rWfapgngoe9o2-ng8ZBr&index=17) - You will have to learn about components and assemblies in order to put together your robot from all the subsystem components. 
    - [Quick overview of Fusion Teams and Projects infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT7d2-zsi28)
    - [Exporting parts from Fusion for 3D printing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ltiZdUFOA)

Remember, if anything is unclear, there are **tons** of resources for learning Fusion (and other 3d modeling software, with same generally applicable guidelines). 
- Create some kind of [enclosure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEdYeQ3NJyQ) in Fusion and 3D print it in the FabLab. This can be any kind of case, box, shell, whatever; look online if you need help, there are plenty of resources. Remember that the FabLab has measurement tools (e.g., calipers) if you need them! This could be for pens, for your phone, for usb sticks, for your keys... whatever!
