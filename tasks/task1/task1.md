## The FabLab

The College of Engineering FabLab in Holmes 448/449 is a fantastic resource for students to get hands-on experience with state-of-the-art rapid prototyping equipment. We will be making use of it throughout the semester as part of creating your robots.
```
The FabLab is a maker space designed for students to fabricate their designs and collaborate. This is a teaching lab â€“ lab members will teach students how to properly use the equipment and software. Once taught, students should be able to teach others. Please stop by or email us if you have any questions or would like to request a tour.

- [Watch this video on the Prusa 3D printer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxUiCqOhTn4) You can also poke around the Fab Lab youtube channel to see other instructional videos!

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to go in the Fab Lab in the next week or so and:
- Introduce yourself to the student staff and make sure they know you are grateful for their help
- 3D print *something*. I suggest you look for something interesting on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)
- Laser cut *something*. I suggest you learn how to draw something for yourself using free software like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
- Locate the soldering station and remind yourself which end of the iron gets hot and should never be touched with your fingers. 

Please bring your creations into class so I can appreciate them.
