## Fusion 360 - ECAD

A great part about Fusion is that you can design electronics (i.e., PCBs) in the same environment as your 3D model. That will help us with properly sizing our boards and placing components relative to their correct place in the enclosure, and, ultimately, ensuring our robot comes together! Here are a few tutorials to watch / follow along with for the electronics design tools in Fusion. As with most software, this is definitely a "learn-by-doing" kind of situation; you won't actually retain much from just passively watching a tutorial, I promise! 

- Watch these tutorials: 
    - [Electronics Project Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jgUZeBiusw&list=PLmA_xUT-8UlL80Xm8Gxz98YNum3I9GInr&index=1)
    - [Design Your First Schematic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cplzhrjvXCQ&list=PLmA_xUT-8UlL80Xm8Gxz98YNum3I9GInr&index=6)
    - [Design Your First PCB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEdnImVezi8&t=4s)
    - [Create Custom Electronic Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqar0XWtFaY) - Unfortunately, not all the parts you need will always be available, and you may have to define custom ones. Luckily, most ICs use standardized packages, so this isn't too painful once you've done it a few times. 
    - [Making an Enclosure Fit a Board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ny4kWdhTbg)
    - [A nice thread on guidelines for drawing good schematics](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/28251/rules-and-guidelines-for-drawing-good-schematics)
    - [Importing EAGLE stuff into Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmA_xUT-8UlL5wTsDLkXtj_nBwojmRf5b) - You will likely see EAGLE schematics and board files available for a lot of open-source stuff. You can import them into Fusion relatively easily. 

- Use the tutorials above as a tool to design your own PCB with an accompanying 3D printed enclosure. For a schematic, try "reverse engineering" an open-source breakout board. Here is [a motor driver board](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-motor-driver-dual-tb6612fng-1a.html), a [mini OLED screen board](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/downloads), a [teeny-tiny ESP32-S3-based board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-esp32-s3/downloads), and a [lithium battery usb-charger board](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microlipo-and-minilipo-battery-chargers/downloads). Remember, if anything is unclear, there are **lots** of resources for learning Fusion on the web. Tutorials for "Eagle" are generally transferable skills as well.
