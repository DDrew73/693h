## Fusion 360 - ECAD

The College of Engineering FabLab in Holmes 448/449 is a fantastic resource for students to get hands-on experience with state-of-the-art rapid prototyping equipment. We will be making use of it throughout the semester as part of creating your robots.


- Register for an Autodesk Edu account and download Fusion 360
- Work through these tutorials I have found for you: 
    - Foo
    - Bar
    - Buzz
    
- Create an enclosure in Fusion 360 and 3D print it in the FabLab. This can be any kind of case, box, shell, whatever; look online if you need help, there are plenty of resources. Remember that the FabLab has measurement tools (e.g., calipers) if you need them!
