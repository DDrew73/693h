## Design Review 2

This group presentation will likely be shorter than Design Review 1, approximately 15 minutes. The same structure applies, and as with DR1 I have provided "templates" with required content for you to use as a foundation. Given the success of the Design Review 1 presentations I do not feel the need to provide overly rigid guidelines on this; follow your instincts!

Your slide decks can be found in [the class drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mq0D-PvM8EMen50F7SRQb9bs8Qb7Vhvb?usp=sharing).

Note that the target date for PCB and parts orders is **March 17th**, so we can use Spring Break for shipping. Please try and hit this target; as we have learned with the first parts order, shipping is going to be a challenge for meeting our aggressive timetable! I believe in us!
