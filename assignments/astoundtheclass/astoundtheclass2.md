## Astound the Class!

Remember that this is a short (~2 minute, 2 slide) individual presentations on any bit of news, cutting-edge research, or fun fact related to autonomous mobile robots and/or multi-robot systems. Examples: Killer robots in Ukraine; Dario Floreanoâ€™s avian-inspired robot legs; How mantis shrimp claws work.

For this second iteration, I would like to encourage you to focus on MULTI-ROBOT systems -- but this isn't mandatory.
